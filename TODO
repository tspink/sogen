Things still to do (NOT an exhaustive list ;)):

* Write a program to automatically generate the <lib>.dll.c file,
  containing the stubs.

* Automate DLL_NAME to pull it from somewhere.

* Automate stub re-writing somehow.

* Make _binary_libname_{start, end} generic, i.e. not dll name specific.

* Rewrite each stub after first call to call the function pointer
  proper, and hence bypass the NULL test.

* Think about multiple loaded assemblies, and the impact that will have
  on loading the runtime/appdomain twice.
  
* Think about multi-threading, and how to invoke mono_thread_attach.
